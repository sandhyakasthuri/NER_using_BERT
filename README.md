# NER_using_BERT
Name entity recogniser using BERT transformer(Hugging faces)

*create an env for install required packages and run the scripts
*we can use the saved model for custome dataset you can modify the scripts and train the model on that data.
*once the model is trained and saved, we can load that saved model and use to evaluate the model by providing the unseen data to model for name entity recognition.

Model Used : BERT transformer from Hugging faces.
*Bert is a pre trained model that has been trained various types of data.
* we can select the required pre trained model from series of the model that made avaialble for custom datasets.
